            <div class="caption">Concept sketch.</div>
            <p>Mycell is an AR app concept. The users place out little virtual mushrooms in real locations and attach a message to it. If someone finds the mushroom with the app open they can read the message. The app was designed to fit the image of pretend game companies we had made up in a previous assignment, where I had made up a company which would focus on non-violent games focused on making games that are "mysiga" ("cosy" in Swedish). The name "Mycell" is a pun on the word "mysig" and "mycel" ("mycellium" in English), which are the roots of fungi. Mycellium connects fungi, and sometimes also other plants, in a network, symbolising the social aspect of the app.</p>

            <div class="caption">The user can read a message another user has left there.</div>
            <p>As the focus is a cosy and friendly atmosphere, it's possible that there would have to be some form of moderation system. One way to arrange this would be to have a system where the user plants a mushroom and then the mushroom has to "grow" before other people can see it and read the message. This would give moderators time to review messages before other users can see them.</p>

            <p><i>Lumberjacked</i> is the project we made for the Game Design course in the Interaction Design program. As part of the course we had to design a game with an unconventional controller. During the first stage of the project we all helped coming up with ideas and discussing and developing them. After pitching ideas to each other within our group, we decided on Viktor's idea of a lumberjack who had to punch down trees, and proceeded to test our idea first with ourselves with a cardboard box as tree, which in combination with boxing gloves would be the "controller". After that we made up some different types of "monster trees" and some game rules for how to attack them, and the winning and losing conditions to test with users.</p>
            <img class="modalimage" src="images/project/lumberjacktest.png" />
            <div class="caption">Here I'm holding the cardboard box. The way I moved the box mixed with sound cues informed the tester on which type of attack the user should use to bring the "monster tree" down.</div>
            <p>It was determined in the user tests that, yes, punching the (very crude, cardboard) monster trees was fun, and something that was important was the ability to get to punch as hard as possible, which would require building a sturdy, puncheable tree trunk. Then we proceeded to build the prototypes of the controller and the game. My roles in this stage was helping to build the tree trunk, drawing the 2D assets for the animations in the game and sewing the hand gloves. In the end, we had built a sturdy tree trunk that could be punched fairly hard, although a cable to the pads that would detect impact came loose inside the trunk after the examinator had tried the game. Fortunately it held long enough to serve as proof of concept, and as we had to dismantle the trunk after the course ended anyway due to lack of storage space it worked out in the end.</p>

            <div class="caption">Assembly of the tree trunk. At this point we had built the framework, added the plates that would detect pressure and soldered on the wires and were adding padding to make it a bit nicer to punch. After this we covered it with wood texture linoleum to make it look like a tree trunk.</div>

            <h1>Interaction Design Bachelor Thesis</h1>
            <h2>"How can I design an educational game that teaches the basics of Arduino to beginners who have felt discouraged from trying to learn coding and technology before?"</h2>
            <img class="modalimage" src="images/project/main.PNG" />
            <div class="caption">Your mentor introduces the world to the user and the course to the user's character.</div>
            <p>For my thesis I made an educational visual novel prototype to teach the basics of Arduino. The abstract for the thesis is: <i>I designed a prototype of an educational game to answer the question “How can I design an educational game that teaches the basics of Arduino to beginners who have felt discouraged from trying to learn coding and technology before?” using a user-centred approach and following game design and instructional video game design heuristics. Once a first prototype had been created I used user tests to evaluate it and the results to iterate on the design. Clarity of visuals, step-by-step instructions and explanations as well as a character to “teach” the user the material, rather than simply reading blocks of text, helped to make the experience of attempting something seemingly complicated less intimidating.</i></p>
            Add image and caption for how it looks when the user uses the prototype!!!!!!!!
            <p>In the prototype, the user will connect a button to the Arduino and program it so that the button releases magic in the game.</p>
