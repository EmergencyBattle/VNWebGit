            <h1>Kramforshjärtat</h1>
            <h2>A Concept Studio 2017 project</h2>
            <img class="modalimage" src="images/project/kramforsbussen_animation.gif" />
            <div class="caption">Illustrations showing a potential concept, a mobile meeting space to complement the current location, illustrated by me.</div>
            <p>As part of the Concept Studio's assignments in 2017 we were given the task to deliver concepts on how to create inclusive spaces. The assignment was given by Kramfors commune and based around the meeting place Kramforshjärtat (The Kramfors Heart), but we were requested to come up with ideas that could be applied broadly to meeting places in general and not just to Kramforshjärtat itself. While Kramforshjärtat provided a much appreciated space notably for asylum seekers and those who have been granted permission to stay in Sweden to meet, talk, and take part of services offered by Hjärtat such as Swedish language lessons and help to find communal services as well as other leisurely activities, Hjärtat did not appeal to the already established Swedish residents, and was also male dominated. In order to successfully integrate all newcomers into Swedish society it is desirable to create connections to other residents as well as to potential employers to encourage both social and professional integration.</p>
			<p>We presented three possible approaches to help solve the problem, which could be employed separately or in combination with each other or other ideas.</p>
			<p>The first one is appointing one or more people who are responsible for planning and overseeing activities and social media presence. Activities need to appeal to as many as possible and be based on what visitors want to do, and should be regular but with the possibility of change based on visitor feedback. They also need to be communicated to both visitors and beyond to inform people that they are happening and invite people to come, regardless of background.</p>
			<p>The second concept was modular and transportable spaces. Spaces should be adaptable to the activities taking place in them, and to some extent transportable. Our suggestions for ways to make a space transportable was to use either a container or a bus. The reason for this concept was that in Kramfors, especially when you have low or no income to spend on the already limited options in public transport, many potential visitors are unable to make it to Hjärtat. This was especially a problem for women with young children. So, if they can't go to Hjärtat, maybe we can take Hjärtat to them instead? That way, Hjärtat could reach areas where people might get isolated.</p>
			<img class="modalimage" src="images/project/kramforsosterian.png" />
			<div class="caption">A counter for the Osteria can be part of a regular meeting space. Illustration by me.</div>
			<p>The final concept we called Osteria, and is based on the idea of using part of Hjärtat as a space where people can bring their food to eat there, in exchange for being able to buy drinks such as coffee or tea if they can and want to, to support the running of the place. In Sweden it is not uncommon for people to make and bring their own lunches to work, and having a space where it's free to bring your own food to would give an opportunity for people from different workplaces to meet up together without having to buy lunch at a café or restaurant, which in turn would bring in a more varied crowd to Hjärtat and potentially introduce them to the activities being held at the place.</p>
			<p>My roles in this assignment included taking part in conducting interviews with both communal employees and visitors at Hjärtat as well as observation sessions, taking part in ideation and evaluation sessions for the concepts and finally to provide illustrations for, and do part of, the final concept presentation.</p>

            <h1>Waste Management</h1>
            <h2>A Concept Studio 2017 project</h2>
            <img class="modalimage" src="images/project/sopstation.jpg" />
            <div class="caption">A user scenario for Slänghjälpen. Illustrated by Rebecca Jäger.</div>
            <p>As part of the Concept Studio's work in 2017 one assignment was to create concepts for solutions to the littering and incorrect handling of waste for a housing company. Despite continuous investment and efforts in building solutions for the tenants and educating them in how and why they should dispose of waste, the rules were not followed which resulted in undesirable conditions, mostly around the waste disposal areas by the apartment buildings.</p>
			<p>After interviews and observations we identified some key problem areas for which we finally developed two solution concepts.</p>
			<p>"Slänghjälpen" (The Disposal Help), was a collection of suggestions on how to motivate tenants to dispose of waste correctly through making the process around it as user friendly as possible. Inside the home we suggested a clearly marked and colour-coded set of containers for easy sorting, which should then correspond to the same colours and symbols for the larger waste containers outside. Among other things, these should be marked consistently in a way that makes them easy to understand even without being able to read Swedish. Ideally, the containers should also be in areas that are well-lit to encourage people not to leave waste just outside the door even during the dark winter months, and should also require as little touching as possible, with container chutes that open and close automatically to encourage people to actually place the waste inside the container. Additionally, we suggested making a Swap Room, where people could leave larger items, such as furniture or other things that others might be able to use, in order to avoid people leaving them in the waste containers illegally.</p>

            <div class="caption">Visualisation of a way to make sorting easy inside the home. Illustrated by Rebecca Jäger.</div>
			<p>The second concept, "Bin-Win", could be combined with Slänghjälpen and relies on rewarding the tenants based on continuous correct waste disposal with perks, such as gardening space or BBQ parties. The system would be promoted and supervised by ambassadors, which would be recruited among the tenants in order to foster a sense of ownership and community.</p>
			<p>In this project I took part in interviews and observations as well as ideation and evaluation of the concepts.</p>

            <p>Sambiblioteket is a building in Härnösand which previously consisted of three libraries in cooperation, but once Mittuniversitetet's university library moved from the building plans were set into motion to move some communal services there and to make the building a social hub. The Concept Studio was tasked with coming up with concepts to inspire the citizens and increase awareness of the facilities and activities in Sambiblioteket and the surrounding city.</p>
			<p>We split our suggestions into two categories: inside and outside the library. Inside the library we focused on creating a guide for how to create a cohesive visual identity that would be able to clearly communicate the contents of the library and the services and activities available. As our assignment was only to come up with concepts, actually developing the visual identity was left to the project owners.</p>

            <div class="caption">A suggestion for a ramp to lead from the park up to a new rooftop garden, illustrated by me.</div>
			<p>Outside the library is a park that was not being extensively used. Because we'd been asked to think big during this assignment, in contrast to our more simple (but essential) suggestions for the inside of the library we gave some bigger suggestions for the outside. There is a road between the library and the park which is rarely used. We suggested removing the road to connect the library to the park, and to use the park more for activities. We also suggested moving the café out of the library and into the park to reduce the noise level inside while keeping the café close, and to build some form of roof or pavilion to make the park a usable meeting space even when the weather isn't clear and sunny.</p>

            <h1>Swedish Language Learning</h1>
            <h2>A Concept Studio 2017 project</h2>
            <img class="modalimage" src="images/project/sprakboxen.jpg" />
            <div class="caption">Presentation image to illustrate the Språkboxen concept. Illustrated by Rebecca Jäger.</div>
            <p>In Sweden there is a problem where migrants who arrive and are granted the right to stay have a difficult time getting employed because they don't speak enough Swedish. Our assignment was to come up with concepts that would facilitate language learning in ways that can be used alongside work training as a complement to SFI (Swedish for migrants).</p>
			<p>During our research phase we discovered that the issue is only partly that migrants need to learn the language. Another part of the issue is that employers to some extent require a much higher level of Swedish proficiency at entry level than is technically necessary to perform many jobs. This in turn also discourages migrants from applying to jobs that they might otherwise be qualified to do, because their (not unfounded) impression is that they need to speak Swedish fluently to get a job.</p>
			<p>To tackle these different angles we developed two concepts: Språkboxen (The Language Box) and Talteknik (can be read both as Speaking Technique and Speaking Technology).</p>
			<p>Språkboxen is a kit aimed for the workplace that contains a guide on how to encourage language training on site during the work day, and different methods, language games and speaking topics to help encourage both migrants and coworkers already fluent in Swedish to converse in Swedish together. This was designed to help encourage employers to employ migrants even if they're not perfectly fluent in Swedish by giving them tools to gradually improve the language situation among the coworkers over time.</p>

			<p>Talteknik is a more tech-oriented concept where we suggest using real-time translation in ear pieces to reduce language obstacles during the work day. There is also the potential to record words and phrases during the day that can later be reviewed to develop vocabulary and improve pronunciation.</p>

            <p>As part of the Concept Studio's assignments we were tasked with creating concepts that could help introduce individuals with necessary competence to employers in the labour market in Härnösand. An issue notably for migrants is that they might not have the necessary documentation to back up their skills, which makes it harder to measure the competence they possess. We thus sought to find concepts to help Härnösand's commune's competence provision.</p>
			<p>K.I.W.I. - Kompetensintegrerings-wiki & informationsdatabas (Competence Integration Wiki and Information database) is a concept for a Wiki-like site where all information regarding companies, job titles, skills required for different job titles and which educations develop those skills, both in Sweden and abroad. The idea is to create a comprehensive network of information for employers, job seekers and people looking for an appropriate education to identify key skills that overlap with their needs, and for the future needs of different industries through statistical analysis of the job markets.</p>

            <div class="caption">A mockup of a job title page for the presentation, created by me.</div>
			<p>C.C.M. - Community Company Mapping is a database of companies and jobs available in different communities, which could link up with K.I.W.I.. This is to help visualise what opportunities might exist near you that you might not have been aware of, and is primarily directed towards job seekers.</p>

The second screen shows the position of a company in AR to help people locate the company in real life while the third screen uses data from K.I.W.I. to show which job titles are employed in the company at the moment and what current job postings the company has published.</div>
			<p>S.U.P.R. - Start-up program is a program intended to support the creation of start-ups. Based on the existing framework in Härnösand's commune and the information available through K.I.W.I. it would be a dedicated, attractive space to get help to start companies, and also provide a location for that company in the beginning stages.</p>

            <p>Mycell is an AR app concept. The users place out little virtual mushrooms in real locations and attach a message to it. If someone finds the mushroom with the app open they can read the message. The app was designed to fit the image of pretend game companies we had made up in a previous assignment, where I had made up a company which would focus on non-violent games focused on making games that are "mysiga" ("cosy" in Swedish). The name "Mycell" is a pun on the word "mysig" and "mycel" ("mycellium" in English), which are the roots of fungi. Mycellium connects fungi, and sometimes also other plants, in a network, symbolising the social aspect of the app.</p>

            <p>As the focus is a cosy and friendly atmosphere, it's possible that there would have to be some form of moderation system. One way to arrange this would be to have a system where the user plants a mushroom and then the mushroom has to "grow" before other people can see it and read the message. This would give moderators time to review messages before other users can see them.</p>

            <p><i>Lumberjacked</i> is the project we made for the Game Design course in the Interaction Design program. As part of the course we had to design a game with an unconventional controller. During the first stage of the project we all helped coming up with ideas and discussing and developing them. After pitching ideas to each other within our group, we decided on Viktor's idea of a lumberjack who had to punch down trees, and proceeded to test our idea first with ourselves with a cardboard box as tree, which in combination with boxing gloves would be the "controller". After that we made up some different types of "monster trees" and some game rules for how to attack them, and the winning and losing conditions to test with users.</p>

            <p>It was determined in the user tests that, yes, punching the (very crude, cardboard) monster trees was fun, and something that was important was the ability to get to punch as hard as possible, which would require building a sturdy, puncheable tree trunk. Then we proceeded to build the prototypes of the controller and the game. My roles in this stage was helping to build the tree trunk, drawing the 2D assets for the animations in the game and sewing the hand gloves. In the end, we had built a sturdy tree trunk that could be punched fairly hard, although a cable to the pads that would detect impact came loose inside the trunk after the examinator had tried the game. Fortunately it held long enough to serve as proof of concept, and as we had to dismantle the trunk after the course ended anyway due to lack of storage space it worked out in the end.</p>

            <div class="caption">Assembly of the tree trunk. At this point we had built the framework, added the plates that would detect pressure and soldered on the wires and were adding padding to make it a bit nicer to punch. After this we covered it with wood texture linoleum to make it look like a tree trunk.</div>

            <h1>Interaction Design Bachelor Thesis</h1>
            <h2>"How can I design an educational game that teaches the basics of Arduino to beginners who have felt discouraged from trying to learn coding and technology before?"</h2>

            <div class="caption">Your mentor introduces the world to the user and the course to the user's character.</div>
            <p>For my thesis I made an educational visual novel prototype to teach the basics of Arduino. The abstract for the thesis is: <i>I designed a prototype of an educational game to answer the question 滴ow can I design an educational game that teaches the basics of Arduino to beginners who have felt discouraged from trying to learn coding and technology before?—using a user-centred approach and following game design and instructional video game design heuristics. Once a first prototype had been created I used user tests to evaluate it and the results to iterate on the design. Clarity of visuals, step-by-step instructions and explanations as well as a character to 鍍each—the user the material, rather than simply reading blocks of text, helped to make the experience of attempting something seemingly complicated less intimidating.</i></p>
            Add image and caption for how it looks when the user uses the prototype!!!!!!!!
            <p>In the prototype, the user will connect a button to the Arduino and program it so that the button releases magic in the game.</p>
